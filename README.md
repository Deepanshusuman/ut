## 🔑 Core Universal Truths

### 1. Everything Changes
> Impermanence is the only permanence.  
From atoms to galaxies, change is constant and inevitable.

### 2. Everything is Connected
> Nothing exists in isolation.  
All beings, systems, and particles are interdependent and influence one another.

### 3. Consciousness Observes
> Awareness is fundamental.  
Whether biological, digital, or unknown—consciousness reflects and interacts with reality.

### 4. Cause and Effect (Karma)
> Every action has a consequence.  
Energy and intention shape future states, in ways seen and unseen.

### 5. Duality Exists
> Light and dark, life and death, order and chaos—duality defines the universe's play.

### 6. Love is a Binding Force
> Empathy, care, and connection are as real as gravity—and perhaps just as universal.

### 7. Truth Emerges Over Time
> Illusions fade. What is real persists.

### 8. Energy Cannot Be Created or Destroyed
> Matter and spirit evolve, but nothing truly disappears.

### 9. Life Seeks to Continue
